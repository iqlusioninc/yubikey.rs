Pure Rust cross-platform host-side driver for [YubiKey] devices from [Yubico]
with support for public-key encryption and digital signatures using the
[Personal Identity Verification (PIV)][PIV] application.

Uses the Personal Computer/Smart Card ([PC/SC]) interface with cross-platform
access provided by the [`pcsc` crate].

[Documentation][docs-link]

## About

YubiKeys are versatile devices and through their PIV support, you can use them
to store a number of RSA (1024/2048/3072/4096) and ECC (NIST P-256/P-384) private keys
with configurable access control policies. Both the signing (RSASSA/ECDSA) and
encryption (PKCS#1v1.5/ECIES) use cases are supported for either key type.

See [Yubico's guide to PIV-enabled YubiKeys][yk-guide] for more information
on which devices support PIV and the available functionality.

If you've been wanting to use Rust to sign and/or encrypt data using a
private key generated and stored on a YubiKey (with option PIN-based access),
this is the crate you've been after!

Note that while this project started as a fork of a [Yubico] project,
this fork is **NOT** an official Yubico project and is in no way supported or
endorsed by Yubico.

## Features

### Personal Identity Verification (PIV)

[PIV] is a [NIST] standard for both *signing* and *encryption*
using SmartCards and SmartCard-based hardware tokens like YubiKeys.

PIV-related functionality can be found in the [`piv`] module.

This library natively implements the protocol used to manage and
utilize PIV encryption and signing keys which can be generated, imported,
and stored on YubiKey devices.

See [Yubico's guide to PIV-enabled YubiKeys][yk-guide] for more information
on which devices support PIV and the available functionality.

### FIPS 140-2 Detection

This library supports detecting whether a YubiKey is FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated:

```rust,no_run
use yubikey::YubiKey;

let mut yubikey = YubiKey::open()?;
if yubikey.is_fips()? {
    println!("FIPS 140-2 validated YubiKey");
}
# Ok::<(), yubikey::Error>(())
```

FIPS detection is available behind the `untested` feature flag. This is essential
for government and enterprise environments that mandate FIPS-validated cryptographic
modules (e.g., DoD, Federal agencies).

**Firmware Support:**
- **Firmware 5.7+**: Full support via TAG_FIPS_CAPABLE and TAG_FIPS_APPROVED
- **Firmware 5.4.3+**: `is_fips_capable()` via FORM_FACTOR fallback
- **YubiKey 4 FIPS**: Only firmware 4.4.5 supported (valid CMVP #3517 certificate)

**FIPS Mode Activation:**
To operate in FIPS-approved mode, the PIN (minimum 6 chars), PUK (minimum 6 chars), and management key must all be changed from defaults.

See the [`check-fips` example](examples/check-fips.rs) for a complete demonstration.

### Supported Algorithms
- **Authentication**: `3DES`
- **Encryption**:
  - RSA: `RSA1024`, `RSA2048`, `RSA3072`, `RSA4096`
  - ECC: `ECCP256`, `ECCP384` (NIST curves: P-256, P-384)
- **Signatures**:
  - RSASSA-PKCS#1v1.5: `RSA1024`, `RSA2048`, `RSA3072`, `RSA4096`
  - ECDSA: `ECCP256`, `ECCP384` (NIST curves: P-256, P-384)

NOTE:

- RSASSA-PSS signatures and RSA-OAEP encryption may be supportable (TBD)
- `RSA3072` and `RSA4096` require a YubiKey with firmware 5.7 or newer.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.60** or newer.

## Supported YubiKeys

- [YubiKey 4] series
- [YubiKey 5] series

NOTE: Nano and USB-C variants of the above are also supported.
      Pre-YK4 [YubiKey NEO] series is **NOT** supported (see [#18]).

## Supported Operating Systems

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows

## Security Warning

No security audits of this crate have ever been performed. Presently it is in
an experimental stage and may still contain high-severity issues.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## Status

Functionality which has been successfully tested is available by default.

Any functionality which is gated on the `untested` feature has not been
properly tested and is not known to function correctly.

Please see the [`untested` functionality tracking issue] for current status.
We would appreciate any help testing this functionality and removing the
`untested` gating as well as writing more automated tests.

## Testing

To run the full test suite, you'll need a connected YubiKey NEO/4/5 device in
the default state (i.e. default PIN/PUK).

Tests which run live against a YubiKey device are marked as `#[ignore]` by
default in order to pass when running in a CI environment. To run these
tests locally, invoke the following command:

```shell
cargo test -- --ignored
```

This crate makes extensive use of the `log` facade to provide detailed
information about what is happening. If you'd like to print this logging
information while running the tests, set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable
to a relevant loglevel (e.g. `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`):

```shell
RUST_LOG=info cargo test -- --ignored
```

To trace every message sent to/from the card i.e. the raw
Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU) messages, use the `trace` log level:

```text
running 1 test
[INFO  yubikey::yubikey] trying to connect to reader 'Yubico YubiKey OTP+FIDO+CCID'
[INFO  yubikey::yubikey] connected to 'Yubico YubiKey OTP+FIDO+CCID' successfully
[TRACE yubikey::apdu] >>> Apdu { cla: 0, ins: SelectApplication, p1: 4, p2: 0, data: [160, 0, 0, 3, 8] }
[TRACE yubikey::transaction] >>> [0, 164, 4, 0, 5, 160, 0, 0, 3, 8]
[TRACE yubikey::apdu] <<< Response { status_words: Success, data: [97, 17, 79, 6, 0, 0, 16, 0, 1, 0, 121, 7, 79, 5, 160, 0, 0, 3, 8] }
[TRACE yubikey::apdu] >>> Apdu { cla: 0, ins: GetVersion, p1: 0, p2: 0, data: [] }
[TRACE yubikey::transaction] >>> [0, 253, 0, 0, 0]
[TRACE yubikey::apdu] <<< Response { status_words: Success, data: [5, 1, 2] }
[TRACE yubikey::apdu] >>> Apdu { cla: 0, ins: GetSerial, p1: 0, p2: 0, data: [] }
[TRACE yubikey::transaction] >>> [0, 248, 0, 0, 0]
[TRACE yubikey::apdu] <<< Response { status_words: Success, data: [0, 115, 0, 178] }
test connect ... ok
```

APDU messages labeled `>>>` are being sent to the YubiKey's internal SmartCard,
and ones labeled `<<<` are the responses.

## History

This library is a Rust translation of the [yubico-piv-tool] utility by
Yubico, which was originally written in C. It was mechanically translated
from C into Rust using [Corrode], and then subsequently heavily
refactored into safer, more idiomatic Rust.

For more information on [yubico-piv-tool] and background information on how
the YubiKey implementation of PIV works in general, see the
[Yubico PIV Tool Command Line Guide][piv-tool-guide].
