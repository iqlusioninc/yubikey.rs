description = """
Pure Rust cross-platform host-side driver for YubiKey devices from Yubico with
support for hardware-backed public-key decryption and digital signatures using
the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) application. Supports RSA (1024/2048)
or ECC (NIST P-256/P-384) algorithms e.g, PKCS#1v1.5, ECDSA
